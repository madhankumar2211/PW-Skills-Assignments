For example, if you want to describe the average income of a group of people, you could use the mean as a measure of central tendency. If you want to describe how spread out the incomes are, you could use the standard deviation as a measure of variability.\n",

For example, if you want to determine if a new drug is effective, you could use hypothesis testing to compare the outcomes of a treatment group and a control group. If you want to estimate the proportion of a population that supports a particular policy, you could use estimation based on a sample of survey data."
