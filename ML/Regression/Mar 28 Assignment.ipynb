    "* The penalty term is a multiple of the square of the magnitude of the coefficients of the regression equation. The penalty term is multiplied by a tuning parameter, called the regularization parameter, that controls the strength of the penalty term.

    "    * **Cross-validation**: This is one of the most popular methods for selecting the value of λ in Ridge Regression. In cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k-folds, and the model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated for each fold, and the average validation error is computed for each value of λ. The value of λ that gives the lowest validation error is selected.\n",

This approach involves finding the value of λ that minimizes the mean squared error of the Ridge Regression model. This approach requires some mathematical manipulation and is often used in situations where the dataset is not too large.\n",

This method is less reliable than the other two methods but can be useful in situations where computational resources are limited.\n",
