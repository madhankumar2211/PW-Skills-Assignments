Overfitting can result in poor model performance on real-world data and reduced model interpretability.\n",

    "    * **Train-test** split: A simple method to detect overfitting and underfitting is to split the data into training and test sets. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. If the model performs well on the training set but poorly on the test set, it may be overfitting. On the other hand, if the model performs poorly on both the training and test sets, it may be underfitting.\n",

    "    * **Cross-validation**: Cross-validation is a more robust method for evaluating the performance of a model and detecting overfitting and underfitting. The data is divided into multiple folds, and the model is trained and evaluated on each fold. If the model performs well on the training folds but poorly on the validation folds, it may be overfitting. If the model performs poorly on both the training and validation folds, it may be underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Learning curves:** Learning curves plot the performance of the model as a function of the training set size. If the model is overfitting, the training error will be low, and the validation error will be high, even when the training set is large. If the model is underfitting, both the training and validation errors will be high, even when the training set is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Regularization:** Regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization can help prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights in the model. If the model has high regularization strength, it may be underfitting, while if the regularization strength is too low, it may be overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Visual inspection:** Finally, visual inspection of the model predictions can be helpful in detecting overfitting and underfitting. If the model predictions closely follow the training data but deviate significantly from the test data, it may be overfitting. If the model predictions are too simple and do not capture the complexity of the data, it may be underfitting."
