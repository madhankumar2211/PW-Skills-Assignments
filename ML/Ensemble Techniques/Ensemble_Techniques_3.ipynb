This process creates multiple trees that have different training data to avoid overfitting.\n",

In contrast, Random Forest Regressor is less prone to overfitting since it combines multiple decision trees that are trained on random subsets of the data.\n",

Decision Tree Regressor doesn't introduce any randomness into the algorithm.\n",
    "    * **Performance:** Random Forest Regressor generally outperforms Decision Tree Regressor, particularly when the dataset is large and complex. Random Forest Regressor can capture more complex relationships between the features and the target variable and provides more accurate predictions.\n",
    "    * **Interpretability:** Decision Tree Regressor is more interpretable than Random Forest Regressor since it creates a single tree structure that can be easily visualized and understood. In contrast, Random Forest Regressor combines multiple trees, making it more difficult to interpret."
