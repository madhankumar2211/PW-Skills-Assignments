    "| **Implementation** | The multiprocessing module in Python creates new processes to execute the code, which allows for true parallelism since each process runs on a separate CPU core. This module requires pickling of arguments and results because each process runs in its own memory space. | The threading module in Python uses threads within a single process to achieve concurrency. Each thread shares the same memory space, which means that variables and data structures can be shared between threads. However, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time, so true parallelism is not possible. |\n",
    "| **Performance** | Multiprocessing is better suited for CPU-bound tasks because it allows for true parallelism, which can result in significant speedup. However, creating and managing processes has more overhead and can be slower than multithreading for simple tasks. | Multithreading is better suited for I/O-bound tasks because threads can perform I/O operations while other threads are blocked. However, due to the GIL, multithreading may not provide significant speedup for CPU-bound tasks. |\n",
    "| **Scalability** | Multiprocessing can scale well with multiple CPUs or cores since each process can run on a separate core.| Multithreading may not scale well with multiple CPUs or cores because of the GIL, which limits the parallelism between threads. |"
